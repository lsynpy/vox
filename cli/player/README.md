## How It Works

- **Audio backend**: `mpv --no-video` running as daemon, controlled via Unix IPC socket
- **Music source**: `~/Music/polaris/` (Artist/Album/ structure)
- **Playlist source**: Polaris server at `http://192.168.100.1:5050`
- **State**: `~/.polaris/player/state.json`
- **Format support**: mp3, m4a, flac, wav, ogg
